# self-balancing-car
The self-balancing car consists of the chassis (e.g. acrylic plates, circuit boards, battery pack, and wiring) supported on two wheels dynamically controlled by DC motors. It was programmed using an Arduino Uno board. The car implements Kalman filtering to reduce noise from signals retrieved from the accelerometer and gyroscope. To maintain balance, a PID loop was introduced to provide the necessary feedback for angle tilt and speeds.
